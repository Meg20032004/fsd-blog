**CBIT Connect: A MERN Stack-Based Blog for Community Building**

In today's digitally connected world, fostering a sense of community within educational institutions is essential. "CBIT Connect" aims to achieve this by leveraging the power of modern web technologies. This full-stack development project, created with my co-coder and teammate Haripriya Madipakam, uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack to create an engaging digital platform exclusively for the Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT) community.

CBIT Connect serves as a virtual hub for students, faculty, and alumni, promoting the seamless exchange of insights, experiences, advice, and knowledge. The platform boasts a variety of features, including user-friendly interfaces, a system for liking, commenting, and sharing, a repository of frequently asked questions (FAQs), and a robust search mechanism.

By integrating these features, CBIT Connect not only enhances communication but also strengthens the sense of belonging among its users, making it an indispensable resource for the CBIT community.
